                This Portfolio is to show some of my past work in form of scientific articles. Also show my skills in the areas of 
                Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Future plans include articles and tutorial on TensorFlow and Pytorch 
                applications.

                        Contract element extraction tries to identify the most important facts and entities of a contract
                        in order to keep an accurate track of a legal corpus. The introduction of neural attention
                        mechanism and morphological word embedding are added to the previously proposed element extractors,
                        the Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory network with a Conditional Random Field (BiLSTM-CRF)
                        and the stacked BiLSTM-LSTM with a logistic regression as a output(BiLSTM-LSTM-LR),
                        to explore their effect on the extracting task. No significant effect was found, on the introduction
                        of attention mechanism. However, statistically significant results with a p-value of 0.006 suggests
                        that the introduction of morphological embedding helps the BiLSTM-CRF and BiLSTM-LSTM-LR architectures perform better.

                        Hex is a classic board game invented in 1942 by Piet Hein and independently by John Nash in 1948.
                        In this paper there is research into Alpha- Beta and Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Hex players,
                        as well as comparisons of different evaluation functions which includes Dijkstra and Electric Circuit.
                        In addition to this Monte-Carlo Tree Search specific heuristics, Upper Confidence Threshold (UCT)
                        and All Moves As First (AMAF), are compared. The most optimal versions of every implementations were found,
                        showing that the UCT policy in the MCTS algorithm has a better performance over all the other techniques tested.

                        Jerry is thinking of going viral on YouTube with inspirational videos about what you should do to be the coolest
                        person in the world. For this reason, he thought of checking what drives the views of TED talks up and collected
                        the information about different TED talks via a scrapping tool.
